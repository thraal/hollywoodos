# HollywoodOS

HollywoodOS is a terminal-based application that simulates cinematic computer activity, similar to what you see in movies. It is built using the Textual framework and supports a plugin system for user-defined display modules.

## Overview

HollywoodOS is not meant to do anything useful. It is designed to look impressive by showing scrolling text, telemetry tables, hex dumps, and other fake "high-tech" content in tiled windows. Each tile is rendered by a plugin conforming to a simple interface.

## Features

- Grid-based terminal layout using Textual
- Pluggable architecture
- Plugin system using regular Python files or modules
- Easy to customize or extend with your own visualizations

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- A terminal that supports Textual
